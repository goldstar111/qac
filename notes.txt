# Implementation Details

## Atomic operation

Qac updates/reads its counters atomically with [GCC's atomic operations][gccatomic].

## rszshm

Qac uses [rszshm][rszshm] to mmap shared memory across processes.
A copy is included in `rszshm` directory. rszshm has the same Apache 2.0 License.

`rszshm` creates a file `0` inside a directory prefixed by `rszshm_xxxxxx`
under `/dev/shm`.

## /dev/shm

On modern Linux `/dev/shm` is mounted as a tmpfs whose size is
typically less than half of RAM (see [tmpfs reference][tmpfs]).

# Bugs

## Lack of Reset API

Reset of a running counter seems to imply extra coordination across its users.

## Memory leak

Reusing a `detatch`ed but not yet `rm`ed counter can leak a small amount of memory
for the unfreed (`rm`) `rszshm` data structure.

## Safety and security

- Treat counters as opaque type
- `detach` counters to prevent accidental modification from a process (safety)
- `rm` counters to prevent leaking information to future processes (security)
- Note that shm files can be read/modified, obeying the usual linux file acccess rights
- If the shm file is removed from the file system `fname` and `rm` raise `'No such file or directory`

### Content of the shm file

```
q)c:init 999999999
q)fname c
`:/dev/shm/rszshm_yjnYJh/0
q)\od -j 24 -l /dev/shm/rszshm_yjnYJh/0
"0000030            999999999                    0"
```

`rszshm` uses the first 24 bytes for its metadata.
